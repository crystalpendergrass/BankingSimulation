Assignment #2 for CPSC2108 [Data Structures]

This assignment was an overall review of CPSC1302 [Computer Science 2], our second course in Java programming.   

The primary data structure used is an array.  Other topics covered included polymorphism and inheritance.

As can be seen in comments, the use of an array is a poor choice of data structure for this assignment.  Also the Transaction class was poorly described in the design documents as well.  The processTran method would be better (and more secure) if placed in a different class.  I would be bothered to learn that my bank must first create a fake or empty transaction to process a real transaction.  In my opinion, this practice is of questionable logic.
